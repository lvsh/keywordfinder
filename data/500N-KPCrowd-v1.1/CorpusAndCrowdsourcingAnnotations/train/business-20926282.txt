On March 2, Kraton reported its fourth quarter results and surprised by 3 cents a share. Earnings per share were 44 cents compared to the 41 cents consensus. The company lost 7 cents in the year ago period. This was the 4th consecutive beat but the company only went public in the fourth quarter of 2009 so there is a limited earnings history. Still, it’s a nice track record to start out beating 4 out of 5 quarters. Sales jumped 21% to $288 million mainly due to higher sales volume which rose 10% and price increases put into affect in response to rising raw material costs. Revenue rose in each of the company’s segments with the largest, Advanced Materials, seeing a 23% gain to $92 million. Even the Paving and Roofing segment saw growth of 31% to $64 million, boosted by increased roofing volume in Europe, of all places, and even in North America. Price increases were enacted to offset higher monomer costs. Paving was weaker, however, especially in North America where there was a lack of funding for infrastructure projects. For the full year, sales volume climbed 18% and revenue soared 33% to $1.2 billion versus 2009. The revenue increase was again driven by higher sales volume and higher prices, boosted by rising material costs. Growth Expected to Continue in 2011 Kraton is bullish on 2011. Based on existing trends, it expects first quarter sales volume to be 5% to 7% higher than the first quarter of 2010. It also believes the pricing for its 3 primary feedstocks, on average, will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Zacks Consensus Estimates Jump Given the optimistic outlook, analysts moved to raise 2011 and 2012 estimates. In the last month, 4 estimates were revised higher for 2011, pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $3.76 from $3.56 per share.
