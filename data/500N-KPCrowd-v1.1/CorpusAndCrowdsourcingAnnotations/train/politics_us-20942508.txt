""NEVER! He is a lowlife bully""
You got to be kidding Colleen Rubino NEVER! He is a lowlife bully. CATCH US on Facebook at www.facebook.com/jerseyjournal. The comments below are on the same subject but from the Internet version of The Jersey Journal opinion pages at www.nj.com/hudson/voices. downrowner President of WHICH COUNTRY? Our present president seems to care for every country but the United States MasterMix At this point and time, no! Still much too do in NJ. YEAHISAIDITANDWHAT YOU CAN LOOK AT CHRISTIE AND SEE HE DON'T EVEN HAVE CONTROL OF HIMSELF - JUST LOOK AT HIS WEIGHT. WHY WOULD I WANT HIM AS PRESIDENT? OBAMA IS DOING A GREAT JOB COMPARED TO THE MESS BUSH HAD LEFT THIS COUNTRY IN, SO STOP COMPLAINING AND JUST DO YOUR PART TO GET THIS COUNTRY BACK IN SHAPE ... THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT CHRISTIE ARE THE MILLIONAIRES ... ALL THE REPUBLICANS DO IS LIE; SINCE THEY TOOK OVER THE HOUSE THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING BUT BLOCK WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO IMPLEMENT TO HELP EVERYONE ... Jehu Christie is Governor only because everyone voted NO to Corzine. shellnation It wasn't Corzine, it was the spending. And where is the spending worse than in Trenton? The answer is D.C. UCBS69 Fat chance I would vote for him, all bark and no bite. He should cut the budget for his meals. shellnation I guess you would have preferred a 25% tax hike and no spending cuts? That is what Corzine pretty much was going to hand to you if re-elected to pay for that $10 billion budget deficit that Corzine left for Christie to deal with when he took over. YEAHISAIDITANDWHAT SHELLNATION, IF CHRISTIE DIDN'T SPARK THE CORRUPTION IN NEW JERSEY RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION CORZINE WOULD HAVE WON. CHRISTIE WAS HEAD PROSECUTOR, SO HE ONLY WON BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ON CORZINE'S WATCH. AT LEAST CORZINE TURNED DOWN THE PAY FOR BEING GOVERNOR AND GAVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE STATE. CHRISTIE CAN'T SAY THAT ... PLEASE SHELLNATION, CHRISTIE MUST HAVE PROMISED YOU SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DEFEND HIM ... rob YEAHISAIDITANDWHAT, commenting on christie's weight and saying he can not be president because of it is no better than somebody saying Obama could not be a good president because he is black. Who cares the color of the skin? who cares how much somebody weighs? Also it is kind of hard to read your posts with all the CAPS. You see how you're the only person typing in caps (those large letters bigger than these)... I support Christie and I am not a millionaire (another fallacy pointed out in your post). YEAHISAIDITANDWHAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT I WRITE IN CAPS; DON'T READ WHAT I POST! ... YOU MUST HAVE A WEIGHT PROBLEM SINCE THAT'S WHAT YOU JUMPED ON. ... PEOPLE ARE DONE WITH THE WHOLE REPUBLICAN, TEA PARTY, OR INDEPENDENT ...
