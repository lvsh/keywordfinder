Ben Barnes' humiliating hairstyles
Ben Barnes has revealed he charted his progress on new film Killing Bono by his changing hair. The Prince Caspian star plays musician Neil McCormick in the comedy about two brothers who fail to make their mark as a band while their classmates U2 shoot to global fame, and had to endure all the embarrassing rock hair-dos of the 80s. Ben said: ""Some actors can chart their journey through their script, but we had hair charts. ""We went from the mop head Beatles-esque school boy through to the dreaded mullet, the New Romantics Duran Duran phase, all the way to shaggy stadium rock. That's basically how we developed our characters."" The 29-year-old actor, who has experienced crowds of screaming girls as he walked the red carpet at Narnia premieres, admits he'd like to be a musician, but insists he doesn't value rock star adulation. Ben said: ""Rock bands are up there to do their thing. That's what they love - to stand on the stage and do that lunge, strut and strum. ""Actors aren't there to walk down a red carpet and wave, that isn't our dream. The dream is to be on a set."" :: Killing Bono is in cinemas now.
