&#34;Glee's&#34; Mr. Schue (Matthew Morrison) to kick off tour in Minneapolis on June 18
Matthew Morrison - Mr. Schue on ""Glee"" - will kick off his first solo tour June 18 at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis. The concert will feature songs from Morrison's upcoming album as well as numbers he's performed on ""Glee."" Tickets will go on sale April 15 but there will be a pre-sale on Monday at www.matthewmorrison.com. Morrison's album, due May 10, will feature duets with Elton John and Gwyneth Paltrow. The first single, ""Summer Rain,"" was co-written by Morrison, Claude Kelly and Espionage. Morrison will perform the song on ""The Tonight Show"" on Wednesday and on ""Ellen"" on April 11. Morrison's five-week tour arrives in Minneapolis 11 days after the cast of ""Glee"" performs at Target Center. Wonder if there will be any duplication in repertoire? For his tour, the ""Glee"" choir director will be using regional glee clubs as opening acts. For details on how to audition, go to www.matthewmorrison.com/gleeclubcontest. JON BREAM
