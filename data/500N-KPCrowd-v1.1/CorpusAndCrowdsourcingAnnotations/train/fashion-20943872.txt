Isaac Mizrahi bridal dream dresses exclusively for The Aisle New York
The Aisle New York, the luxury e-commerce site now has six bridal gowns created for exclusively by the one and only Isaac Mizrahi. These gowns, are made to order, are available in sizes 0-14, or can be custom made-to-measure. Unlike their weekly ""flash sales"", for all members of The Aisle New York, this collection will be available this entire season. That's six months long to drool over the beautiful collection Mr. Mizrahi has styled just for them. So what are the key selling points? Prices range from $2,200 for a silk mini with a flower appliqué to $4,500 for an ivory peplum gown with a grosgrain belt. His miniaudieres and jewels will also be available for purchase (so a complete one-stop-shopping experience). Major - Each will be delivered to you, the customer within two (that's right NOT a typo - two) weeks of purchase. There is no other store, site, or place on the planet that can offer that to you, the bride. So even if you decide say Monday, you wanted a gown - it would be available at the end of the month. I KNOW!! Advertisement What I love about The Aisle New York, is that all of the designers whose dresses are sold on the e-commerce site, donate a portion of the sales to their favorite charity. Yes, I love a designer that gives back! In this case, a portion of proceeds will be donated to Isaac's favorite charity, Good Shepherd's Services. So congratulations to you lucky brides, this is indeed a rare opportunity to have something designed by Isaac. The boutique opens on Monday, April 5. www.TheAisleNewYork.com
