A City Winner Now Competes Against the World
One of the high school science fair competitors we featured a few weeks ago was a winner at this week's New York City Science and Engineering Fair (the one that President Obama visited) and will be one of 15 students representing the city at the finals of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Los Angeles next month. Savera Dhanraj, 17, a senior at Health Professions and Human Services High School in the East Village, was recognized for project analyzing heavy-metal concentrations on the beach in Howard Beach, Queens. (The beach tested negative.) Her mentor on the project was a Nazrul Khandaker, a geologist at York College. At the international finals, Savera will be competing against about 1,300 other contestants for $4 million in prizes and awards; about a quarter of the contestants win something. City Room wishes Savera the best of luck.
