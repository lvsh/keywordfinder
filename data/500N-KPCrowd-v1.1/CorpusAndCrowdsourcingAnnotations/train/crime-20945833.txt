""Westside Rapist"" pleads guilty to seven killings
A former state insurance-claims adjuster pleaded guilty yesterday to seven sexually motivated strangulation killings of older women decades ago across Los Angeles County. John Floyd Thomas Jr., 74, whom Los Angeles police detectives called the ""Westside Rapist,"" pleaded guilty to the murders that took place in two waves, during the mid-1970s and the other a decade later. Los Angeles police described Thomas as one of the region's most prolific killers, responsible for as many as 30 slayings and about two dozen sexual assaults. His plea in court yesterday was for seven killings. A break in the case came in 2008, and Thomas was arrested in 2010 after DNA matches were made. - From wire reports
