Time Warner Cable boosts iPad app channel lineup
Making good on its promise to fill the void left by yesterday's removal of nearly a dozen channels from its iPad app, Time Warner Cable has added 24 new ones. Sixteen of the new channels are immediately available to all customers; three local channels are only available to users in the Austin and New York markets, according to the company. Included in the main list are news stations like CNN, C-SPAN, and MSNBC, along with entertainment diversions like the Food Network and Travel Channel. Joining that list by tomorrow morning are five more including Bloomberg, Sprout, Hallmark Movie, Current, and TruTV. Facing mounting legal pressure from News Corp., Viacom, and Discovery, Time Warner Cable yesterday announced the immediate removal of 11 of its channels from those networks. The company vowed it would fight to get the cooperation of those networks, but said that it was removing the offending channels in the interim. Time Warner Cable's iPad app arrived on Apple's App Store a little more than two weeks ago, and has since been download 300,000 times, according to the company. Using the app, people who are subscribers of Time Warner Cable's TV and Internet services can watch live TV while on a Wi-Fi network.
