Marsden's kids don't like seeing dad on screen
LOS ANGELES - One of the reasons James Marsden took on the starring role in the family film ""Hop"" was so that his two children could see his work. But Marsden says that 10-year-old Jack and 5-year-old Mary don't really like seeing their dad on screen. His son watched ""X-Men,"" but preferred Wolverine over Marsden's Cyclops character. When Marsden's daughter saw ""Enchanted,"" she wanted to ""fast-forward past dad's stuff and watch the dragon."" The 37-year-old actor says that children think movies are real, so it must be unsettling to see their father shooting lasers out of his eyes, as in ""X-Men,"" or waving a sword while singing and dancing, as in ""Enchanted."" Besides, Marsden doesn't mind if he's not his kids' favorite actor, as long as he's still their No. 1 guy.
