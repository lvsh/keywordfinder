Movie review: Hop
With aspirations of becoming a drummer in a rock ""n"" roll band, and reluctant to take over his father's job, E.B. (short for the Easter Bunny and voiced by Russell Brand) takes off to Los Angeles. Enroot, Fred (James Marsden), an out-of-work slacker, accidentally injures E.B. in a car accident and must take him in as he recovers. As Fred struggles with the world's worst houseguest, they both learn what it takes to finally grow up. The ""pleasant surprise"" factor is always rewarding. ""Hop"" nicely blends state-of-the-art animation with the live action, and offers wideappeal to both younger viewers with a fresh look at the Easter Bunny, and for adults the view of parenthood expectations of their children, provides a nice family break.
