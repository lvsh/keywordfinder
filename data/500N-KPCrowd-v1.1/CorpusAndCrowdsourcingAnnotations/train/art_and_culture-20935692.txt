The NEW &quot;The Hangover Part 2&quot; trailer
The Wolfpack is Back! This, according to the teaser trailer for ""The Hangover Part II"" which came out a short while ago. Movie audiences did not get much information about the plot, just pals Phil, Stu, and Alan (Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms) walking through the streets of Thiland with a small monkey leading the way. The new trailer now let's us in on the plot of the film. Check out the trailer in the sidebar to see what it's all about. Some characters from the first movie is back along with some new ones (I'll let you see the trailer for yourself so I don't spoil any surprises for you). Following up the most successful R-rated comedy of all time will be tough. My first impressions of this trailer is not steller, but perhaps you will feel different. Please let me know. Enjoy!
