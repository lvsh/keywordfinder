Barbour's wife ""horrified"" at presidential prospects
(CNN)- The wife of Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour says she is ""horrified"" that her husband is seriously considering a bid for the presidency. In an interview with CNN affiliate WLOX in Biloxi, Marsha Barbour admitted the ""overwhelming"" task of a presidential run is something she may not quite be ready for. ""It's been a lot to be first lady of the state of Mississippi and this would be 50 times bigger,"" she said. ""It's a huge sacrifice for a family to make."" The governor is still testing the waters of a potential bid for the 2012 Republican nomination and has made no formal announcement regarding his intentions. But Marsha Barbour revealed she is wary of a 10-year commitment she believes would accompany a presidential run - and, presumably, two terms in office - during ""the last part of our productive lives."" Despite her hesitation, Barbour said that the final decision is up to her husband. ""That's a commitment that I am praying about,"" she said. ""And if God and Haley decide to do it, I'm sure God will give me strength to be a good partner.""
