Spring-like and practical with it Going down Too-long trouser hems As in trying to make that Céline skateboard ad work in the real world. Face it: you'll trip and ruin your trousers Self-harm by social media The people you follow on Twitter/befriend on Facebook purely to torture yourself with how fabulous they are. Yes, you do.
