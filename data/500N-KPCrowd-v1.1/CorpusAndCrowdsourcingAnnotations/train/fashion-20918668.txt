Hot Pants
The red trouser has been one of those under-the-radar microtrends riding alongside obsessions like camel-colored everything. This spring however, it's reached critical mass. Maybe it all started with the sleek cigarette style by the Row or a cherry-legged and leather-jacketed Agyness Deyn. Either way, tucked between blue jeans at Mother, Genetic Denim and Uniqlo are ruby red shades that can't be resisted any longer - like these cayenne-colored stiletto Current/Elliott jeans. It's time to go shopping.
