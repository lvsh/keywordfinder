MYLEENE KLASS SHOWS OFF HER NEWBORN HERO
MYLEENE Klass introduces her newborn daughter to the world by posting this picture on the internet. The TV presenter, 32, who gave birth a week ago, chose the social network site Twitter to show off baby Hero Harper Quinn yesterday. The tender family shot, taken by Ms Klasss fiance Graham Quinn, shows the model and former pop star snuggled up to her eldest daughter, three-year-old Ava Bailey, and tiny Hero, who was born last Friday weighing in at 6lb 2oz. She captioned the photo: World meet Hero, Hero meet world! One whole week old today! (Dads the official photographer!) Ms Klass had kept her 85,000 Twitter followers informed throughout her pregnancy and many were quick to send their best wishes and comments on the new arrival yesterday. Many wrote: She is too cute and Congratulations. Ms Klass responded: You guys!! I am completely and utterly overwhelmed by all your kind msgs for my family. Thank you so very much. Last month the star had herself covered in plaster to make a mould of her pregnant tummy before putting a picture of it on Twitter. She wrote: Getting completely plastered today!
