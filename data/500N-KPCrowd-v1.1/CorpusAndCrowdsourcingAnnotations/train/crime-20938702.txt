SC man charged after 13 dogs found wild in home
CAYCE, S.C. – Police in South Carolina have charged a man with animal cruelty after more than a dozen dogs were found running wild in a house in a suburb of Columbia. Cayce Public Safety Department spokesman Lt. J.S. Simmons said six dogs were shot and killed this week at the house because officers could not catch them and one officer was bitten. Simmons described the dogs as large mixed breeds resembling Rottweilers and pit bulls. Six dogs were rescued, but four of those had to be euthanized because of health issues. Two of the rescued dogs were turned over to a local shelter and one dog escaped. Dennis Reidy remained in jail Friday awaiting a bail hearing on animal cruelty charges. Jail records did not indicate whether he has an attorney.
