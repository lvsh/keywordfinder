Ultra low calorie diet advertisement is banned from TV
An advertisement for a diet involving a calorie intake of around a quarter of normal recommendations has been banned for misleading viewers. LighterLife was criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for not living up to its promise of medical support. The commercial said the diet was ‘subject to GP’s health check and monthly reassessment’. But the ASA found the medical support offered was inadequate. It ruled that the advertisement, which showed a slim woman dancing with an obese cardboard cut-out of herself, also created the false impression that the diet was a long-term solution. The ASA had received a complaint from a customer who said the promised support failed to materialise. Dieters with three stone or more to lose eat four ‘foodpacks’ a day consisting of soup, shakes or cereal bars. They take in 530 calories a day – compared with the 2,000 recommended for a woman and 2,500 for a man. The advertisement was taken off air in 2009 but LighterLife, based in Harlow, Essex, had appealed.
