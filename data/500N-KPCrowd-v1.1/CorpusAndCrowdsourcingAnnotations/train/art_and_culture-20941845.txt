Back on? Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have been &#39;hanging out a lot&#39; five months after split
Talk about an encore! Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have apparently flipped the switch on their on-off relationship back to on after splitting - for the second time - in November. The ""Last Song"" co-stars have ""been hanging out a lot,"" a Hemsworth source revealed to E! Online. And though ""they've been trying to do it away from the cameras,"" the pair was spotted together in a car Thursday - the first time they've been spotted together since their breakup. Cyrus, 18, is in the midst of preparing for an international tour that kicks off April 29 and will conveniently bring her to Australia - 21-year-old Hemworth's native country - for more than a week in June. STARS WHO GIVE LOVE A SECOND (OR THIRD) TRY ""I may or may not be single,"" the singer said on Australia's ""The Kyle and Jackie O Show"" earlier this week. ""But I love Australian boys, obviously."" ""We're very close,"" Cyrus said of Hemsworth. ""I'm definitely not coming to Australia single."" A source told People last fall that it was entirely possible the young stars would give their love another try. ""Their on- and off-again relationship is currently off,"" the insider said. ""But you never know with Miley and Liam. They could be back on at some point."" And it seems ""some point"" is now.
