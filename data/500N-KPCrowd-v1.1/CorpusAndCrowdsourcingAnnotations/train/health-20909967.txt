Meet the woman who can't close her eyes
She won $115K in suit against plastic surgeon, but says she's still at risk for blindness It's been nearly six agonizing years since a failed cosmetic surgery left Marilyn Leisz unable to do something most of us take for granted. Even now, after 30 surgical attempts to correct the problem, the New Jersey woman can no longer fully close her eyes. Even the simplest things - showering, sleeping - have become a nightmare. ""To take a shower, I have to put gel into my eyes so the water and the soap doesn't get into my eyes. Then by the time the shower is done, the gel's washed out,"" Leisz told TODAY's Ann Curry Friday. And that's not all: Each night before bed, she has to coat her eyes in gels and medication, then don a mask to keep from scratching her eyes in her sleep. The fear of infection, glaucoma brought about by her medication, corneal ulcers and blindness haunts her continuously, she said. On Wednesday, Leisz won at least a partial victory: A jury awarded her $115,000, finding that the surgeon whose work has left her unable to even blink had deviated from accepted practices when he performed the operation. However, the same jury rejected her claim that she had not been warned of the dangers.
