Fukushima radiation in Washington State milk and water

In addition, air and water monitoring has detected elevated radiation in Washington State and other West Coast states. These reports are of particular concern to pregnant and breastfeeding women and infants who are most vulnerable to radiation. However, Governor Chris Gregoire said tests confirmed the contaminated milk is safe to drink. The CDC/EPA/FDA jointly assured that current levels of radiation in rainwater are below concern. The EPA reported that levels of radiation detected by filters are slightly higher than the previous week. Radiation levels in the ocean near the Fukushima Daiichi plant have reached 4,385 times the regulatory limit, prompting the decommission of its crippled reactors.

This, however, should be done with caution and medical advisement, especially when breastfeeding.
