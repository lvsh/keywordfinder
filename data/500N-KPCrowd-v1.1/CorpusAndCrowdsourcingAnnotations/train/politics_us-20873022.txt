EPA? ECZ? Acronyms cause confusion over budget deal
All of the hubbub Thursday over the White House possibly capitulating to House Republicans and agreeing to include some anti-EPA riders in a pending budget deal might have simply come down to a misheard acronym. “I think there was some confusion by some people, somebody,” Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, head of the Congressional Black Caucus, told POLITICO. Cleaver (D-Mo.) was referencing an AP article late Wednesday that cited an anonymous Democratic lawmaker stating that President Barack Obama made it clear with the caucus that the White House would have to include Republican riders trumping some EPA rules in a deal to avoid a government shutdown. “It’s not a story,” Cleaver said. “Somebody got confused. I think people got EPA and ECZ mixed up.” Cleaver said Obama was actually referring to community empowerment zones, which are generally referred to as CEZs. A readout of Wednesday’s meeting between the president and the caucus referenced that one of the topics was empowerment zones in persistent poverty communities. Cleaver said he was not aware of any concern over EPA riders. The story set off a frenzy of backlash from environmental groups Thursday that only ceased when the White House issued a statement opposing the GOP riders. Cleaver also issued a one-line statement saying the source was “inaccurate.”
