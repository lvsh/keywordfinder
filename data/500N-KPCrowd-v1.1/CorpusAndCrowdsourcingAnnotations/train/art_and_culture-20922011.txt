Steve Carell ""Seeking a Friend"" with Keira Knightley
Steve Carell is no longer officially keeping Office hours, but he’s already lined up his first post-Michael Scott role. The actor’s rep confirms a Deadline report that Carell will play a lonely man who sets out with his neighbor to locate his high school sweetheart before the imminent end of the world in the aptly-titled, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World . Keira Knightley is currently in negotiations to join him — not as the high school sweetheart, but as the road-tripping neighbor. Lorene Scafaria, who scripted Nick & Nora’s Infinite Playlist , wrote the screenplay and will direct. The film begins shooting May 16. Carell’s summer is now almost booked, as he follows Seeking a Friend with Great Hope Springs , opposite Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.
