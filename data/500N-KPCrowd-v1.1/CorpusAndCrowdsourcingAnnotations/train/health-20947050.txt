Fake Weed Claims Another Naval Academy Student
— The synthetic fake weed known as ""spice"" — the scourge of America's armed forces — has claimed the career of another Naval Academy midshipman, bringing the total number of students expelled for taking bong rips of expensive oregano to 12. From Reuters: ""Our purpose is to produce leaders, and as such, we will not graduate or commission any illicit drug user. This type of character flaw is simply incompatible with leading the Sailors of the 21st century,"" Vice Admiral Michael H. Miller, Superintendent of the Naval Academy, said in a statement. It's bad enough that they're being expelled, but at least they could go down for smoking real weed. What a disgrace.
