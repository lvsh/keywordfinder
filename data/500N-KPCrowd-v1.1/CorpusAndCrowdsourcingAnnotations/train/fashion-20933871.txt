Dov denies bankruptcy
Bankruptcy for American Apparel? A lot of overblown legalese, says CEO Dov Charney. The struggling hipster clothier said in its annual 10-K report this week that it may be forced to file for Chapter 11 as it reported a shocking $86 million loss for 2010 amid plummeting sales and dwindling cash. But Charney - who is occupied not only with saving his apparel company but with fending off a number of sex-harassment suits, including one that accuses him of keeping a former employee as a sex slave - told The Post in an interview yesterday that bankruptcy ""isn't in the realm of likely possibilities"" for American Apparel. ""We're not going bankrupt,"" Charney told The Post, although the famously randy clothing designer stopped short of repeating earlier statements to the media that the chances of a Chapter 11 filing were as little as 1 in 1,000. ""This is going to be the year that American Apparel comes back,"" Charney added. ""I'm incredibly excited about all of the opportunities in front of us."" Charney cited progress the retailer has made in replacing and training 1,500 workers that were dismissed following a 2009 immigration bust, as well as spring and summer fashions flowing to stores after several seasons of spotty deliveries. Nevertheless, one source admitted Charney's vocal optimism is making some executives nervous as the company scrambles to line up fresh sources of financing. ""Dov's optimistic,"" American Apparel lawyer Peter Schey told The Post yesterday. ""You have to be to achieve what he has."" Shares of the company yesterday plunged as much as 27 percent before recovering to close down just 6.6 percent, at 90 cents. In addition to its miserable results, American Apparel said two partners from key lender Lion Capital have left the board.
