Katy Perry accused of copying Lady Gaga who is accused ripping off Madonna!
Katy Perry's new music video ""E.T."" premiered this week and critics are already saying it bares too close a resemblance to Lady Gaga's ""Born the Way"" video. All the different outfits that Katy Perry wears as she travels through the solar system searching for her soul mate, are being called ""Lady Gaga like impersonations,"" according to Contact Music. Twitter is alive with tweets comparing Katy's new video to that of Lady Gaga's, with one critic saying ""Katy Perry's new video for ""ET"" is too Lady Gaga for my taste."" Even the heavy make-up and stylish hairdo's are ""Lady Gaga like"" according to various tweets.

Lady Gaga has been accused of being a modern day version of Madonna and pulling all her ideas from the ""Material Girl"" herself. Does this mean that Madonna had such an influence over music that what we are seeing today are descendents from her creations? Madonna passes it down to Lady Gaga who in turn wears off on Katy Perry? What a blood line! Lady Gag was in Hartford, Connecticut in the fall and many of the outfits she wore, did resemble the things we saw Madonna wear in her hay day. Reference: Contact Music
