Facebook Launches New Mobile Site
In the past, Facebook had used two different mobile sites: one optimised for touch screen devices (touch [dot] facebook [dot] com), and a standard mobile site for all other devices (m [dot] facebook [dot] com). In terms of UI aesthetics, the touch site was superior in that it features some nice AJAX support, which made loading things very quick. It was, however, lacking in some functionality; for instance, you couldn't view or manage your pokes. The main feed was also plagued by the issue of it displaying posts and status updates from eight hours ago, rather than showing the latest (at least, that was an issue I experienced). The new site looks like a sort of combination between the previous two incarnations of Facebook Mobile, and also is much more of a Web app rather than a bog standard mobile version of Facebook. Every feature is there, including the ability to check in to venues using Facebook Places. There are certainly a lot of design hints taken from Facebook's hugely successful iPhone app, in particular the nice little ""Like"" or ""Comment"" popup when you press the ""+"" button next to a friend's post. The layout of everything, including the three tabs at the top enabling you to access your profile, messages, and ""more"" options, is reminiscent of the new Facebook layout you see on your desktop. All in all, it's a pretty cool redesign that irons out all of the issues that the two previous versions of Facebook's mobile site had, and unifies their better features. So far, I've had no issues, and as Facebook say, the new site looks great in pretty much every browser.
