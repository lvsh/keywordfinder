Pistons retires Rodman's No.10 jersey
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) - NBA team Detroit Pistons retires rebounds legend Dennis Rodman's No.10 jersey during the half time break when Pistons hosted Chicago Bulls on Friday. A ""Dennis Rodman 10"" banner was slowly raised to the rafters. And Rodman showed his appreciation to the Pistons and the city of Detroit by holding a T-shirt with ""Thank you Detroit"" on it. During a pregame press conference, tears streamed down both his cheeks. ""It's a surprise to me that my number is being retired,"" Rodman said. Rodman, nicknamed ""Worm"" was selected by Detroit in the second round of the 1986 draft out of Southeastern Oklahoma. Despite averaging just 7.3 points a game, he is regarded as an all-time great because of his ability to guard point guards or centers and grab rebounds at both ends of the court. The two-time defensive player of the year and two-time All-Star set an NBA record by leading the league in rebounds over seven straight seasons. His controversial antics went well beyond his body piercings, tattoos and numerous wild hair-dye colorings, including run-ins with referees, opponents and even teammates as he became the prototype for a Pistons lineup that became known as the ""Bad Boys"". ""It's a well-deserved honor for Dennis,"" said Dumars, the Pistons' president of basketball operations. ""He was one of the great Bad Boys.""
