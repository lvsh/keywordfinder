&#039;Dark Shadows&#039; update: Chloe Moretz in talks to join cast
If I wasn't already totally pumped for Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"" movie (which I already was), the latest casting news would be enough to do it. Chloe Moretz is reportedly now in talks to sign on. According to Deadline Hollywood, the young star of ""Kick Ass"" and ""Let Me In"" would play Carolyn, daughter of Collins matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, who's going to be played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Moretz, who just wrapped on Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo Cabret,"" played a vampire in ""Let Me In."" Carolyn became the victim of vampire Barnabas Collins in earlier incarnations, notably the feature based on the original soap, ""House of Dark Shadows."" Carolyn is clearly going to be younger in this version. Moretz is only 14. This will be her second outing with Johnny Depp, who is playing Barnabas Collins in Burton's movie, and is top-billed in ""Hugo Cabret."" Advertisement ""Hugo Cabret"" also features Sir Christopher Lee, for my money the best screen Dracula. Yesterday it was announced that young Aussie actor Gulliver McGrath, who auditioned for the part of Hugo Cabret would be playing the role of David Collins in ""Dark Shadows."" The part of Hugo Cabret ultimately went to Asa Butterfield, but McGrath did end up with a small part in the movie. David is the charge of governess Victoria Winters, a classic mold gothic heroine who will be played by Bella Heathcoate. It's widely believed at this point that Michael Sheen, known to be circling the project, will play David's father, Roger Collins.
