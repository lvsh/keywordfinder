As part of a trend that has seen several brands launch collections of ""greatest hits,"" US designer Donna Karan lets you slip into something more comfortable with her new Casual Luxe line of easy yet luxurious pieces. An update of her original ""seven easy pieces"" - a range of combinable items launched in the 1980s that featured her famous bodysuit - the release comes shortly after other labels including Givenchy and Tim Hamilton have launched reduced collections, meant to make up entire wardrobes. Including a stretch pant, stretch skirt, a t-shirt, a big sweater, and several vests, Karan's cleanly cut items - made from luxurious materials are designed to be layered onto each other for a sophisticated on-the-go look.
