Violet and Lace: Penelope Cruz, Vanessa Hudgens, Karolina Kurkova
There was a common theme this week between Penelope Cruz and Vanessa Hudgens, and Penelope and Karolina Kurkova. On April 1, Penelope joined Johnny Depp as she received her own star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides actress once again turned to L'Wren Scott for her outfit. Penelope was on-trend with her violet lace dress. While the fitted silhouette showed off her amazing post-pregnancy figure, Penelope was mostly covered up with ¾ sleeves and a knee-length hem. Statement earrings and Christian Louboutin peep-toes completed her charming outfit.
