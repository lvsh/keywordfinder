The Nationals' workout video
“New intro video with players working out. OK...” Ben Goessling wrote from Nats Park on Thursday. “Finally, a Nationals television ad that doesn’t suck!” Nationals Enquirer wrote when a version of this workout footage made it on television. Personally, I’m all in favor of workout videos. I just wish this one had Matt Stairs running stairs.
