Swaziland serial killer sentenced to death
MBABANE, Swaziland – Media in Swaziland say a serial killer has been sentenced to death. State TV showed David Simelane listening calmly as Judge Jacobus Annandale sentenced him Friday. Executions, carried out by hanging in Swaziland, are rare in this southern African kingdom. The last to be carried out was in 1983. Simelane was convicted last month in the deaths of 28 people, most of them women and children. The case has moved slowly through the courts since Simelane was arrested in 2001.
