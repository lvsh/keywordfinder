Dennis Rodman says he's headed for Hall of Fame
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) - Dennis Rodman has been voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Rodman says he was informed Thursday to be in Houston for Monday's announcement before the championship game of the NCAA tournament. The five-time NBA champion and two-time defensive player of the year was honored Friday night by the Detroit Pistons, who retired his No. 10 jersey during halftime of their game against the Chicago Bulls. Rodman was among 12 finalists for the Hall of Fame this year along with players such as Jamaal Wilkes, Maurice Cheeks, Chris Mullin and Ralph Sampson. The induction ceremony is in August. Detroit selected Rodman in the second round of the 1986 draft of Southeastern Oklahoma. The native of Trenton, N.J., also played for Chicago, San Antonio, the Los Angeles Lakers and Dallas.
