An American study of the prevalence of multiple partner fertility has found that 28% of all US women with two or more children have children by more than one man. ""I was surprised at the prevalence,"" said demographer Cassandra Dorius, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. ""Multiple partner fertility is an important part of contemporary American family life, and a key component to the net of disadvantage that many poor and uneducated women face every day,"" he said.
