New AIDS report sets zero new infections goal
NEW DELHI (AP) — The United Nations has set an ambitious goal of zero new HIV infections and zero AIDS-related deaths by 2015 as the next stage of the war against the deadly virus, a new report said Friday. The U.N. Secretary-General's 2011 Report on AIDS highlights new strategies in the fight against the disease and urges universal access to treatment, care and support for those infected with the virus, and an end to discrimination against them. The report, released by the United Nations office in New Delhi, noted an overall global decline in HIV infections, but cautioned against any complacency, noting that every day more than 7,000 people, including 1,000 children, are newly infected by the virus. ""The number of people newly infected with HIV declined by 19 percent in the decade before December 2009, with at least 33 countries experiencing a decline in HIV incidence of at least 25 percent,"" the report said. But despite the overall decline, the number of infected people is increasing in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, North Africa and the Middle East and parts of Asia. ""No country has escaped the devastation of this truly global epidemic,"" the report said in a summary of the 30 years since AIDS emerged as a major health challenge across the world. In those three decades, AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives and more than 60 million people have been infected by HIV. But health experts, speaking at the function marking the release of the report, said all was not doom and gloom and there was plenty of good news coming from AIDS prevention and treatment programs worldwide.
