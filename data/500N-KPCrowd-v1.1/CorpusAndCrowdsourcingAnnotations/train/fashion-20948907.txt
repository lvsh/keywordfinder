Nicky Hilton shows off her figure in daring lace panel vest top and slashed denim shorts
It's not your average shopping outfit, even in sunny Los Angeles. Then again, Nicky Hilton, 27, is not your average girl. The hotel heiress put her assets on full display, as she dressed in tiny, cut-off denim shorts and a printed vest-top with a daring panel of black lace across her chest. She paired the outfit with high heel, nude coloured peep toe pumps, which looked like they are not exactly sensible for walking very far. The socialite and fashion designer tends to try and play it a little more low key than her attention loving big sister, Paris, but from time to time she shows that she can demand the spotlight just as much, when she chooses. Nicky was spotting walking out of the Barneys New York yesterday afternoon. She left the shop empty handed, although she tweeted that she had picked up something from reality star-turned-fashion designer Whitney Port's clothing line. ""@whitneyEVEport Love your line! Just picked up some dresses! Xo,"" Nicky wrote. Last weekend Nicky joined Paris, several other celebrities and 2000 other people to take part in a two mile charity run raising money for the earthquake and tsunami relief efforts in Japan. The ‘Tokidoki Youth Relief/Red Cross Run’ was arranged by Transformers star Josh Duhamel and involved his wife Fergie and Glee actress Diana Agron. The charity has sold 90,000 T-shirts and raised over $130,000.
