Penelope Cruz gets Hollywood Walk of Fame star (AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) — Penelope Cruz has been enshrined in concrete. The Oscar-winning actress unveiled her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame star Friday, flanked by leading men Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp. The event is timed ahead of next month's release of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" in which she stars with Depp. The Spanish star says that when she came to the United States in 1994, she only knew how to say ""How are you?"" and ""I want to work with Johnny Depp"" in English. She jokes that now, she knows how to say ""I want to work with Johnny Depp again."" The 36-year-old actress co-starred with husband Bardem in her Oscar-winning role in ""Vicky Christina Barcelona."" They welcomed their son in January.
