Game of the Day / Phillies 5, Astros 4
PHILADELPHIA - John Mayberry Jr. lined a pinch-hit RBI single off closer Brandon Lyon to cap Philadelphia's three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning Friday, then, at right, received the congratulations of Ryan Howard. On a day when the Astros' Brett Myers nearly stuck it to his old team by outdueling Roy Halladay, the Phillies came up with a dramatic comeback in their six-hit ninth against Lyon. ""It's all I can ask for for my first Opening Day,"" said Mayberry, a former Stanford player and son of former major-leaguer John Mayberry. ""My parents were here. It's a special day for us."" Trailing 4-2 to start the ninth, the Phillies got going when Jimmy Rollins and Howard singled. After Raul Ibañez popped up, Rollins stole third and Ben Francisco lined an RBI single. Carlos Ruiz followed with a single, and Wilson Valdez hit a tying single that kept the bases loaded with one out. Mayberry then sent a shot over drawn-in center fielder Michael Bourn, kicking off a celebration after he touched first base. ""I saw momentum continue to build, and nobody wanted to make the last out,"" Mayberry said. Myers, the Phillies' opening-day starter from 2007-09, allowed two runs - one earned - and three hits in seven innings. Halladay, the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, allowed one run and five hits, striking out six in six innings. Myers had two of those hits. After Halladay departed trailing 1-0, the Astros scored three in the seventh, with Bourn's two-run triple the key hit. A sacrifice fly by Howard and RBI groundout by Ibañez got the Phillies within 4-2 in the bottom half.
