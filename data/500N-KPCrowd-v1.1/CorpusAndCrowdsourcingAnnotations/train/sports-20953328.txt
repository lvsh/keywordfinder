India player ratings against Sri Lanka in Cricket World Cup 2011 final
How the India players rated as Mahendra Singh Dhoni's side lift the Cricket World Cup trophy in Mumbai after defeating Sri Lanka. Virender Sehwag - 1/10 Very quiet day with a second-ball dismissal and an injured right shoulder that didn’t let him bowl or throw. An even greater triumph without him. Sachin Tendulkar - 3 Useful little contributions with bat, ball and in the field but nothing substantial - certainly no 100th international hundred. Gautam Gambhir - 9 Didn’t quite round his innings off with a century but still a pretty brilliant one that would have brought him the match award on most days. Virat Kohli - 5 Stabilised India’s reply with Gambhir after the early loss of both openers, fielded well and chipped in with an over. MS Dhoni - 10 Promoted himself to go after Sri Lanka’s off-spinners and did all that and more. Couldn’t have captained, kept and batted better. Yuvraj Singh - 9 After conceding 36 from his first six overs he did well to complete his allotment for 49. Then proved an able finisher, and player of the tournament. Suresh Raina - 4 Fielded pretty well, which is notable as India have had few fielders of athleticism. A useful anchor at number seven. Harbhajan Singh - 8 To concede only three fours on a slow but true pitch, and with short boundaries, was pretty outstanding - and, as usual, under-appreciated. Zaheer Khan - 7 Set the tone by starting with three consecutive maidens, but was taken apart - by his masterly standards - at the death, his last ball swiped for six. Munaf Patel - 7 Kept the lid on Sri Lanka while bowling his first six overs for 18 and nibbling the ball around, even if enormous ability not quite fulfilled. Shanthakumaran Sreesanth - 4 Giving away two free hits was pretty inexcusable, but he didn’t completely crumble, even if he couldn’t complete his quota.
