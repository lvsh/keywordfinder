Spanish jailbird is as sly as a fax
MADRID - Spanish police say they have arrested a man who twice escaped from custody by having his wife send fake faxes ordering his release. Jose Carlos Serna, 57, was arrested yesterday at his home in a suburb north of Madrid after being found hiding in a hollowed-out sofa, police said. In December, he was in a cell at a courthouse awaiting trial when officers got a fax purportedly from a regional court. It was followed by a phone call purportedly from a court official, corroborating the release order. He was then freed to a waiting taxi. Police said Serna used the same trick to escape from a jail in October. - Associated Press
