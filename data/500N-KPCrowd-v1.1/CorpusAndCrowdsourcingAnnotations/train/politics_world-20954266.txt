Chelsea enter the race for &#xa3;8m QPR playmaker Adel Taarabt
Chelsea are expected to join the chase this summer for QPR forward Adel Taarabt. The 21-year-old Morocco international, who has two years left on his contract, looks set to leave Loftus Road in the summer even if Rangers win promotion to the Premier League and would command an asking price of around £8million.
