Gillard wakes up to long-term threat
BOB Brown wants the Australian Greens to be a mainstream political party. The long-term Green dream is to shift from power-sharing with Labor in government to supplanting the ALP. Julia Gillard, after entering a formal alliance with the Greens to form a minority government, has realised, in the wake of the NSW electoral disaster for Labor, that the Greens are a threat to her short-term credibility and long-term political appeal. After relying on written undertakings with the Greens and rural independent MPs to form a government last year, the Prime Minister has become increasingly alert to the need to frame herself as a conservative, middle-road Australian than she is perceived to be. At the same time, she is distancing herself from the Greens, who find themselves facing real media scrutiny for the first time. Gillard has been putting herself in the middle and setting Labor against the ""extremes"" of the Coalition and the Greens. The Labor leader and some of her ministers have started using strident language to condemn the Greens' policies and paint them as being unworldly and not a party of government. At the same time, the Greens' leader has been pushing his party as mainstream, reasonable and responsible as he tries to pick up Labor voters and any Liberals who want action on climate change. While blaming ""the hate media"" - specifically The Australian for reporting the Greens policy of a boycott of Israel - Brown conceded yesterday that it cost the Greens votes in NSW and was wrong. It put the Greens back in the extreme shade and made the long-term hope of replacing a major party (Labor) less likely. As Nationals' senator Ron Boswell noted yesterday, the Greens in the Senate opposed a motion moved last week to denounce the Israeli boycott but yesterday was saying it was the wrong thing to do. The Greens can't keep having a bob each way, as Boswell said last night.
