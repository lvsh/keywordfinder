Rotherham forward Nico Steenkamp suspended for banned stimulant after drinking energy supplement
Rotherham forward Nico Steenkamp has become the latest player to be suspended after testing positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine, after it was found in a contaminated shipment of the energy drink Anabolic Nitro. Steenkamp on Friday received a three-month ban just 24 hours after Sale Sharks prop Karena Wihongi received a four-month ban for testing positive for the same drug. The Rugby Football Union heard that Steenkamp, a double glazing and window installation fitter, had started taking the drink to combat fatigue as he tried to combine a full-time career with rugby training and matches. He tested positive on Jan 8 when Rotherham played Cornish Pirates. Meanwhile, in the Premiership on Saturday, Northampton coach Jim Mallinder will be hoping that the arrest of Ben Foden on Monday for alleged criminal damage – and the resultant adverse publicity – will not slow his team’s momentum. Northampton returned to form with a 39-3 win over Wasps last week and now face Mallinder’s old Sale. “We need to make sure we are on our game,” he said. “We are determined to finish in the top four, and to do that we have to make sure we win our home games.” Cardiff Blues scrum-half Richie Rees returns to action against the Ospreys after serving a 12-week ban for making inappropriate contact with the eye area of Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley during a Heineken Cup tie in December.
