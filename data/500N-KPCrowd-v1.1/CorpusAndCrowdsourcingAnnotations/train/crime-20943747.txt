London 2012: Third arrest over explosives found in a car at Olympic site
A third person has been arrested at London's Olympic Stadium site on suspicion of supplying explosives. The 61-year-old man is being questioned by police after officers from the Olympic Site Support Unit stopped and searched a woman in a car park off Pudding Mill Lane on Tuesday. The 40-year-old woman was a security guard at the site and she was arrested along with a 43-year-old man on suspicion of possessing explosives. The woman, employed by a private security alarm, was also arrested for possession of class A drugs. She is alleged to have said that the substances were used for training dogs. Officials have stressed that the safety of the stadium was never at risk and Scotland Yard has said the latest arrest was part of an ongoing investigation into where the substances had come from. The 61-year-old was detained by police yesterday and taken to an east London police station for questioning. The same night that police arrested the woman they stopped and searched another car on the M11 but nothing was found in the car and the driver was free to leave. Searches were carried out at houses in Kent and London, but no other substances have been found. The man and woman in their forties have both been bailed until late April. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘The Counter Terrorism Command is aware but the incident is not being treated as terrorism related.’ Work on the £486m Olympic stadium, which has an 80,000 capacity was officially completed this week. The venue will hold thousands of people from across the world when the Olympics start in July 2012. A spokesman for the Olympic Delivery Authority said: ‘There are robust measures to ensure the safety and security of the Olympic Park. ‘We are working with the police in their investigation. At no point has the safety and security of the Olympic Park been put at risk.’
